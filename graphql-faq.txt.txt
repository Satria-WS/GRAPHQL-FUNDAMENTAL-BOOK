what is GraphQL ? 
open source server-side technology to optimize RESTful API calls

why GraphQL ?
when the data gets more complex, the routes get longer. Sometimes it is not possible to fetch data with a single request. This is where GraphQL comes handy.
GraphQL structures data in the form of a graph with its powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving, and modifying data.


different GraphQL vs REST ?
RESTS having multiple endpoints
GraphQL having single endpoints
